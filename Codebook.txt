Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, 
LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and 
gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz.
These signals were used to estimate variables of the 561 features in the original data set.

For each record in the original data set, it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

This TidyData data set is an extract of the original data set with 20 variables in each row.  

The first two variables are:
- Subject: a number label between 1 and 30 identifying the individual being measured
- Activity: a 6-level factor identifying the activity being performed

The following remaining 18 variables are each the mean of the corresponding measurements 
for the particular individual performing the particular activity identified in the first two variables.
Values of the features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].  
- BodyAccMeanX: mean of mean body acceleration in the X direction
- BodyAccMeanY: mean of mean body acceleration in the Y direction
- BodyAccMeanZ: mean of mean body acceleration in the Z direction
- BodyAccStdX: mean of standard deviation of body acceleration in the X direction
- BodyAccStdY: mean of standard deviation of body acceleration in the Y direction
- BodyAccStdZ: mean of standard deviation of body acceleration in the Z direction
- GravAccMeanX: mean of mean gravity acceleration in the X direction
- GravAccMeanY: mean of mean gravity acceleration in the Y direction
- GravAccMeanZ: mean of mean gravity acceleration in the Z direction
- GravAccStdX: mean of standard deviation of gravity acceleration in the X direction
- GravAccStdY: mean of standard deviation of gravity acceleration in the Y direction
- GravAccStdZ: mean of standard deviation of gravity acceleration in the Z direction
- BodyGyroMeanX: mean of mean angular velocity in the X direction
- BodyGyroMeanY: mean of mean angular velocity in the Y direction
- BodyGyroMeanZ: mean of mean angular velocity in the Z direction
- BodyGyroStdX: mean of standard deviation of angular velocity in the X direction
- BodyGyroStdY: mean of standard deviation of angular velocity in the Y direction
- BodyGyroStdZ: mean of standard deviation of angular velocity in the Z direction
